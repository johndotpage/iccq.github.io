We believe that the quality of the source code that millions of programmers
write every day could be much higher than it is now. We believe that the
contribution computer science can make to improve this situation is greatly
undervalued. We aim to solve this problem by gathering
together cutting-edge researchers and letting them share their most recent ideas.
