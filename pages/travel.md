# Travel Information

You will need to obtain a [tourist visa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_policy_of_Russia)
to travel to Russia, either in Russian Embassy or Consulate in your country.
They will ask you to provide
your original passport, visa application form, two passport-size photos,
hotel confirmation, and flight tickets.
The visa will be issued in up to 30 days and will cost up to $120.

ICCQ will be held in the Higher School of Economics (HSE)
at [11, Pokrovsky Blvd in Moscow](https://goo.gl/maps/B587C4Q8YdBZZ7WT9).

We recommend you to use [Uber](https://www.uber.com/) as a taxi service.

Moscow has three international airports:
[DME](https://www.dme.ru/en/),
[SVO](https://www.svo.aero/en/main),
and
[VKO](http://www.vnukovo.ru/en/).
Uber from any one of them to your hotel will take about an hour
and will cost about $30.

We suggest you to stay in one of these hotels:

  * [Boutique Hotel Chemodanov](https://chemodanov-hotel.ru/en) (0.7km from the venue)

  * [Custos Hotel Lubyansky](https://custoshotels.com/custos-hotel-lubyansky/?lang=en) (0.9km)

  * [PR Myasnitsky Boutique Hotel](https://prhotelgroup.ru/en/) (1.3km)

You can find many restaurants near by your hotel and most of them will be
good. We also recommend you try one of these high-class restaurants and taste
traditional Russian cuisine:

  * [Ruski](http://ruski.354group.com/en/) (approx. $30 per person)

  * [Selfie](https://selfiemoscow.ru/en/) ($50)

  * [Dr. Zhivago](https://drzhivago.ru/en/about) ($60)

It may be a bit cold in Moscow in March; check
